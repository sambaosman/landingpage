# Landing Page Project
##Things added
The project began as a static page. Using primarily javascript, another section was added to the end of the previous sections and styled the same way. The navigation bar was also added so that when clicking on a link, it would scroll that particular section into view and add the active class to it while removing the active class from the rest of the sections that were previously clicked.
